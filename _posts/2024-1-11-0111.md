I most recently shared my thoughts on the promise and perils of AI in the “Future of Entertainment” session of my “How Hollywood Works” course at Taipei National University of the Arts (which you can also watch below), touching upon practical inevitabilities, historical precedents, creative opportunities and ethical considerations…
