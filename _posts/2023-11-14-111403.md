I’m pitching tellretell’s hard sci-fi anime epic, ORION DSSR: Deep Space Salvage & Recovery, tomorrow morning at the Taiwan Creative Content Fest in the Taipei New Horizon Building, 6th floor. Co-creator Nicolas Vallet will be there in spirit via his conceptualization and amazing artwork. 🙌

The animation section runs from 10am-noon, each pitch is just 8 minutes, and we’re project #6, so do the math re your arrival time. 🤓 

That said, the entire animation pitch program is *fantastic* — starting strong with BRIAN and finishing fabulous with ZSAZSA ZATURNNAH vs The Amazonistas of Planet X — so carve out two hours of your time tomorrow morning and thank me later. 😏
