"Snow Leopard" tells the story of how humans and animals finally get along . A snow leopard broke into a herdsman's sheepfold and killed nine goats. The son insisted on killing the leopard, but the father insisted on letting the snow leopard go. As a result, the herdsmen father and son were at loggerheads.

The film had its world premiere in the non-competition section of the 2023 Venice Film Festival and its North American premiere at this year's Toronto Film Festival .

"Director Wanma Tseden is the world leader in Tibetan-language films and the pioneer of Tibetan-language films.

Because of his experience in writing novels, the director has injected a lot of avant-garde literary genes into the film . In his nearly two decades of directing experience, he has carved out his own film territory on the world film map.

The 2015 "Tallow" has an asymmetrical structure and a black-and-white mirror image presentation, which depicts the protagonist Tarlow in an almost sculptural manner.

Then in 2018 , "Kill a Sheep" fully drew on the elements of western films and genre films, the two-line plot structure, the conversion of virtual and real photography, and the staggered changes of interior and exterior scenes, creating a psychedelic effect for the film like stealing dreams and interpreting dreams.

In 2019 , "Balloon" returned to the track of realism. Following the meticulous and simple shooting techniques of the past, it meticulously restored the family life of herders and opened up a confusing world on the screen that looks like a dream but not a dream.

"Snow Leopard" took three years to complete. The film continues the realistic style that the director is good at, and adds CG technology to the film aesthetics. It is the world's first high-definition digital snow leopard image. "

During the Q&A session after the premiere of "Snow Leopard", Naozo Ichiyama, chairman of the Tokyo Film Festival's film selection committee, introduced the situation of director Banma Saiten to the audience.

He said the director passed away in May after filming his last film , "Snow Leopard," which was completed by his son (Kumi Nariye) and will be released next year. Placing "Snow Leopard" at this year's Tokyo Film Festival pays homage to a beloved pioneer of the new wave of Tibetan cinema.

Mr. Naozo Ichiyama also introduced that Jinba and Wanma Tseten have collaborated on many works . Jinba recalled that he and Wanma Tseden started cooperating in "Talow". Both of them spoke very little, but gradually understood what the other wanted. This was how they cooperated.

Xiong Ziqi said that she likes "Kill a Sheep" and "Balloon" very much, and has always wanted to work with director Wanma Tseden, but there is no suitable role. He happened to meet the character Wang Xu in "Snow Leopard". He worked hard and finally got this opportunity. He was very lucky.

Caitin Tashi also recalled one of the things that impressed the director the most: He had always liked Tibetan costumes and thought they looked very good, but he had no chance to wear them. Later, on the day when the film was finalized, the director prepared Tibetan costumes for him and they took a group photo.

He also said that he wanted to be a lama before, but because he was an only son, he could not stay away from home. Maybe this is why director Wanma Tseden asked him to play the role of the lama. I am very grateful to him.
