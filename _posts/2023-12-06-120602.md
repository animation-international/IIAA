The on-site shooting on June 2nd and June 3rd is the most important teaching part of this training camp. The tutor group selected classic clips from the French movies "About Us" and "Marriage Story" as models for imitation filming. At the same time, they led the students to take the initiative and adapted the script to a certain extent based on the on-site conditions. For example, in the film "About Us", the original rivalry between father and daughter was changed to a rivalry between mother, daughter and sisters. The change made the characters closer to the age and campus life of the actors, making it easier to promote on-site creation efficiently.

The two-day shooting day was divided into four sections, morning and afternoon, which were divided into directing team, actor team, photography team, production team, art team, and the film crew composed of these combinations. Photography practice. In this offline training camp, the director group is divided into director, executive director, scene recorder, second assistant director and third assistant director. During on-site shooting, the director team is not only responsible for creation, but also takes into account the coordination of various departments on site to a certain extent. During on-site shooting, each assistant director performs his or her own duties, allowing the director to more freely control creation, which may be a more efficient execution method.

Director Chen Jialuo served as the director of the morning group on June 2. Regarding how to guide actors in multi-lingual situations, the French instructor replied, "In the early homework, the director is already very familiar with the script, so even if he cannot fully understand the actor's lines, it does not hinder him." Emotional perception. During rehearsals and filming, we pay more attention to the actor's state and emotional mobilization. Even if the performance rhythm may not be as good as normal due to language differences during filming, the common emotions in the performance can still be felt by the creators."

On the afternoon of June 2, Han Liang, director of the directing team, served as the director. He said, "The teacher explained that the French crew and directing team have heavier responsibilities and a wider scope of work. The script should record the rise and fall of each line with a camera to ensure that the scene is picked up and edited. Point. The most important thing in shooting is the actor's performance, and editing is also about editing the performance. In addition, if the movement of the camera affects the audience's attention, it is disturbing the audience."

"Hectic and busy" and "interesting" are the adjectives of the director team Ke Zhijie on the morning of June 3rd. "Several French tutors were very serious and responsible. They came into the group with us in advance to arrange the arrangements, and also chose a more suitable classroom according to local conditions. As a shooting location. Although there are only three shots, the instructors have a clear shot scheduling design, and I am deeply impressed by their ability to capture the character's state and coordinate their movements. Everyone on the scene performed their duties, and although there were minor situations, everything was always There will be solutions. I also benefited a lot from the mentor's emphasis on group collaboration and various work details."

The afternoon show on June 3 was still shot outdoors in the bright weather. The director team He Yintianxiao adapted the character settings based on the characteristics of the actors to find more reasonable motivations for the characters’ dialogue. He said in the director’s explanation: “ This is a play about the relationship between sisters. The two people still have a close relationship, but they hide something from each other. In the play, the sister first breaks the window paper and proposes a plan to move away, and after a fierce but honest argument , the sisters get back together. I hope to unfold the story relatively objectively from the sister’s point of view before the sister proposes the plan. Then I switch the point of view to the sister through a long lens, trying to capture her external reaction and reaction to this. Psychological state, thereby constructing a dynamic proactive changing relationship, and making a long dialogue scene as rich and interesting as possible through scheduling."

The cooperation between the director and the editor is often related to the final effect of the film. On June 4th, the intense and orderly shooting practice ended, and the training camp entered the post-production stage. After the editor makes a rough cut, the instructor guides the students to make a fine cut together. The French instructor led the students to find the most suitable one from different materials - the actor's performance, the rhythm of the screen movement and whether the sound is connected to the scene are all factors that need to be considered. The rhythm between the front and back shots, the repetition of shots and lines, and the lengthy lines in the performance can all be discarded.

But editing is not a puppet show. Experienced editors will provide unique opinions and insights based on the director's requirements.

Christian Rajaud, the mentor of the production team, emphasized in his summary that producers are very important in film creation, whether it is an author's film or a commercial film. However, there are still some differences in the position of the producer in various countries. The United States is a producer-centered system, China is a director-centered system, and France is somewhere in between, with the status of the producer and director being equally important.
