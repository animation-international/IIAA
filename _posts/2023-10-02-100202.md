Yesterday’s iPhone 15, the top model rushed to 13999

This netizen joked: It’s so expensive. When did mobile phones become more expensive than computers?

It is true that with this money you can buy a nice macbook. If you say so, have you ever seen a camera that is more expensive than a car?

What a coincidence, it was yesterday that Sony launched such a machine.

It's called "Sony BURANO".

So big?

Nononono.

That's what it looks like with a big lens and various accessories inserted into it.

Actually very small.

This is the essence.

Square and upright.

Magnesium alloy body.

It's Sony's top-of- the-line digital movie camcorder.

The reason why it is top.

Because it is the world’s first digital movie camcorder using PL-mount.

Supports PL mount and E mount.

explain--

E-mount is for Sony autofocus lenses, P L-mount is used with high-quality cinema lenses.

Body 2.4kg, plus lens.

Very suitable for handheld photography of girls.

Tired of taking it.

Connected to T- shaped handle and viewfinder arm.

You can also take pictures of girls by carrying the telescope while walking.

Because the body uses a thinner electronic variable ND filter and optical image stabilization structure.

Support built-in anti-shake.

If the girl doesn't tremble, you can be steady if you tremble.

This also becomes Sony's first digital film camera to support both PL mount lenses and built-in anti-shake system.

8. 6K full-frame sensor.

New XAVC H format using MPEG-H HEVC/H.265 high compression rate codec.

Dual native ISO (800/3200) and 16 stops of latitude.

Steady shots of girls in low light.

Built-in AI smart chip.

Supports fast hybrid autofocus.

Steady photos of girls in action.

> Provides a more efficient focusing solution when shooting irregular or high-speed moving objects.

Multiple internal recording formats.

Includes XAVC and X-OCN (LT).

Explain--

X-OCN is Sony's original compressed RAW format that captures information captured using 16-Bit color depth data.

Provides filmmakers with greater freedom in post-production color grading.

3.5-inch screen, supports touch focus.

Wow so powerful.

This changed my impression of movie cameras.

BURANO also has two 3-pin XLR audio inputs and a headphone terminal.

All menu buttons are located on the same side of the camera operator and tally recording lights are designed in three positions.

Suitable for one person to work.

And equipped with two VPG400 certified CFexpress Type B memory card slots.

Supports high bitrate video data writing including X-OCN (LT) 8K.

This is the return of digital cameras to their origins.

What's the price?

RMB￥200,000.

I said with conscience that this is a very good machine, but it only sells for 200,000 yuan, which is too cheap. I will not buy it this time and leave some inventory for everyone.

Come on, friends?
