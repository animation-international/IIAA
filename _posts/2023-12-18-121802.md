On December 11, 2023, the graduation ceremony of the international course between Beijing Film Academy and Weta Studio, the world's top film studio, was held at Beijing Film Academy. Attending the ceremony that day were Weta Studio founder Richard Taylor, Weta Creative Director Sam Gao, Weta Studio Department Director 김가륜 (Karyoon Kim), Beijing Film Academy Vice President Sun Lijun, Director of Academic Affairs Tong Lei, School of Animation Dean Li Jianping, Deputy Dean of the School of Animation Huang Yong, Deputy Dean of the School of Animation Ma Hua, Secretary of the Party Branch of the School of Animation Li Liang, Deputy Dean of the School of Digital Media Liu Mengya, School of Animation Wang Hao, School of Digital Media Wang Jinning, School of Digital Media National Tianyi, as well as undergraduate and graduate student representatives from the School of Animation and the School of Digital Media. Weta Studio is a world-leading comprehensive visual effects studio that has won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects five times. The physical special effects in the movies "The Lord of the Rings Trilogy", "The Hobbit Trilogy", "The Wandering Earth", "Avatar", "King Kong" and other films all came from this work room. International dignitaries such as Prince Charles of the United Kingdom and the Crown Prince of Brunei have visited the studio.

This is the first time that Weta Studio has opened international courses with an international school. The first batch of courses lasted for one semester. The five students selected were composed of undergraduates and graduate students from the School of Animation and the School of Digital Media. They came from animation majors, animation Ada experimental class, comics major, digital media major and other different subject areas. After two rounds of selection since April 2023, based on comprehensive assessments of professionalism, character, language ability, etc., we will finally go to Weta Studio Headquarters in Wellington, New Zealand for one semester of course study. Weta Studio has established a strategic partnership with the Beijing Film Academy in 2003. The founder of Weta Studio, Mr. Richard Taylor, and Professor Sun Lijun have established a deep friendship during the 20-year cooperation process. In 2023, Richard Taylor will serve as the Prime Minister of New Zealand. The delegation's speech mentioned the cooperation with Professor Sun Lijun and the Beijing Film Academy, as well as Gao Xia, an outstanding graduate of the Beijing Film Academy, who serves as a close colleague and close partner to establish a bridge between Weta and China. This time Weta has a teaching linkage with the Beijing Film Academy. , reached a consensus on the design of international talent training goals, taught students in accordance with their aptitude, demonstrated teaching, and collaborated to light up the highlight moment of Beijing Film Academy’s international cooperation.

At the ceremony, the international teaching teams from both sides watched the course completion videos of five students and listened to the students’ creative reports and experiences. Professor Sun Lijun gave the students’ evaluation of the course in his speech. This is an important teaching practice since the establishment of friendly cooperation between Beijing Film Academy and Weta Studio 20 years ago. It is of great significance to both parties and the five students sent to study have gained a lot. Different from short-term exchange visits, this one-semester international course adopts the international credit exchange system, which opens up the joint internship practice content of Beijing Film Academy and Weta Studio, which greatly enriches the teaching content of the Film School.

The three instructors of this international course, Richard Taylor, Sam Gao, and Karyoon Kim, spoke highly of the five students respectively. Richard Taylor said in his speech that the five students from Beijing Film Academy showed amazing talents and extraordinary enthusiasm during the course. Recalling the tense scene when the five of them reported for the first time in the early stages of their studies, Richard Taylor personally demonstrated how to "sell" their project. Richard Taylor not only taught them production techniques, but also taught them how to display and express in three dimensions. I am sincerely happy with the progress of the five students in the one-semester course, and welcome the five students to work in Weta Studio after graduation.
