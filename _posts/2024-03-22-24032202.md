Société Nationale des Beaux Arts
Founded in 1890 - Recognized as a public utility in 1909
Paris, March 14, 2024
Dear Sir,
I am writing to express my sincere appreciation for your creations, which are accompanied by memories of the stay in Beijing, and especially of your warm invitation to your studio, extended by Madame Isabelle Lawson, Director of the SNBA, an association of artists which I have the honor to preside over. On this occasion, you generously donated two ink on paper works to the SNBA. I thank you immensely, Sir, for your offering which will add to the artistic heritage of our Foundation where China is beautifully represented. In return, I am pleased to offer you these words, which I hope will harmonize with the beautiful effects of your brushes.

Some thoughts and notes on the work of SUN Lijun
Mr. SUN Lijun brings life and sound to his images. Modernity is embraced by Mr. SUN, one that disrupts the ancestral traditions of the Middle Kingdom. However, Mr. SUN still uses the brush, one of the treasures of the literati painter, along with ink, the inkwell, and paper. The brush, this marvelous tool, dances gracefully on the beloved paper. Mr. SUN brings movement and sound to Chinese painting, which was once accompanied by poetry in the stillness and silence of words. The static figures born from the brush's arabesques articulate in another life.
Mr. SUN's characters resemble the Ink Splashed Immortal by Liang Kai. Do not these children of progress bear a resemblance to their ancestors frozen on rice or mulberry paper?
Mr. SUN is among the talented Chinese artists who move forward in contemporaneity while remaining imbued with tradition. At times, he forsakes animation to assert himself in a wide variety of expressions. Sometimes, all the nuances of ink animate dream landscapes, then a completely spontaneous graphic style unfolds on large surfaces, and then we notice that he does not disdain the color ignored by Painter Poets.
Painting, a thought in action, has thus become one of the highest expressions of Chinese spirituality, as indicated by François Chen. The emptiness of the Tao contains everything: it is manifestation, it unfolds the cosmos.

Is not the perpetual gravitational void of interstellar space the guardian of movement?
Mr. SUN Lijun generously pursues a thought in action.
Hoping for a future meeting, please accept, Sir, my warm regards.
