This is an ancient mountain village with a history of more than 2,300 years, located on the south side of the Great Wall of the Ming Dynasty, at the junction of Mentougou District in Beijing and Huailai County in Hebei Province. "Water Bag" was once a water house used by Fangkou Village to draw water from wells. It looks like a yurt and was built using bricks from the Great Wall. Later, when running water was provided in village, the water bag was abandoned and transformed into the current water bag art museum.

It is understood that the operation model of Shuibao Art Museum is to introduce art to mountain villages and auction some of the art works on display, with all the proceeds donated to the Fangkou Village Elderly Charity Canteen. Over the years, Shuibao Art Museum has used art as an innovative driving force for the inheritance of public welfare, and has better promoted the development of local art public welfare.

"The Great Wall is Long and Long" is the latest series of Shuibao Art Museum's 2023 charity exhibition series. This "Autumn Notes" artist joint sketching exhibition invited five contemporary Chinese artists including Meng Luding, Gu Liming, Li Shuan, Li Di and Fan Beilu to create joint works. They used paintbrushes to record the local customs of Fangkou Village and exhibited their works at Shuibao Art Museum. Curator Zhang Xiaoling believes that these works will serve as a testimony to this land. He hopes that the vitality of this peaceful village at the foot of the Great Wall will last forever.
