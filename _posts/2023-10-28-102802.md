An experienced executive with a strong history in enterprise application, market strategy, and international partnerships, Christopher established the first VTuber industry group in Taiwan in 2017 — with 15 participating companies and universities conducting technology forums and contests. Christopher subsequently founded - and directs - the Asian Virtual Human Association in 2021, promoting immersive experiences with virtual humans through international events, academic workshops and business partnerships.
