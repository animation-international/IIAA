Chinanews.com, Taiyuan, August 12th (Reporter Yang Jieying) 

On August 11th, the premiere of the virtual character sci-fi movie "Fly to the Moon" was held in Taiyuan, Shanxi.

"Fly to the Moon" is directed by Sun Lijun, Wu Xian, produced by Shanxi Yirong Cultural Media Co., Ltd., Fanjian (Beijing) Cultural and Creative Co., Ltd., and Beijing Shengshi Shunjing Cultural Media Co., Ltd., starring Dong Hao and Su Na, Liu Chunyan and Li Yang participated in the dubbing.

The film tells the story of an "old naughty boy" Dong Dabao who lives alone and loves to toss in 2050. Suddenly, he receives a companion robot "grandson" Dong Xiaobao bought by his son who is thousands of miles away. His life suddenly undergoes earth-shaking changes. By chance, the two got to travel to the moon together.

"Flying to the Moon" adopts a combination of "real-life shooting + animation special effects", takes the family relationship between the elderly living alone and the artificial intelligence robot as the theme, and combines visual elements such as future technology and moon landing wonders to form a unique video narrative style.

It is worth mentioning that "Dong Xiaobao" used the whole process of motion capture technology behind the scenes to complete the character shaping. With the help of technology presentation, through facial expression motion capture and body motion capture, the whole process was captured and detailed to the joint movements of the hands, which changed the traditional programmed acting of animation characters.

At the premiere, the main creative team of the film shared their views and insights on the film with everyone.

"This is a caring, warm and inspirational movie for Chinese children. It conveys positive and sunny energy to the society, and at the same time conveys China's own aerospace development and popular science knowledge through the work." Sun Lijun said, "Flying to the Moon" is an extension of digital film and television production technology in children's film themes.

Except for Dong Hao, who is a live-action actor, the rest of the film are animated characters. The combination of real people and animation is undoubtedly a challenge for the main creative team.
